## Development Status Summary

### ‚úÖ **Architecture Complete (100%)**
- Modern React-based UI matching original layout
- Comprehensive state management system
- All UI components and interactions implemented
- Frame template system fully functional
- Excellent TypeScript typing throughout

### üîÑ **Core Features In Progress (60%)**
- **Image manipulation system**: UI complete, Fabric.js integration pending
- **Text rendering system**: UI complete, Korean font rendering pending
- **Export system**: UI complete, high-resolution processing pending

### ‚è≥ **Advanced Features Pending (20%)**
- High-quality image processing with Sharp.js
- Korean font rendering with italic transformations
- 1200 DPI export functionality
- Performance optimization for large images

## Quality Checkpoints

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues
- **23 linting warnings** (mostly missing return types)
- **Test warnings** (React act() wrapper needed)
- **Console.log statements** in development code

### ‚úÖ Passing Checks
- **TypeScript compilation** - No errors
- **Build process** - Successful
- **Test suite** - 45/45 tests passing
- **Component architecture** - Clean separation

## Next Development Phase
**Priority**: Fix code quality issues first, then implement Fabric.js canvas integration

**CRITICAL**: All automated checks must pass before proceeding with new features:
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run format && npm run test
```

## Migration Progress vs Original Python
- **UI Parity**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **State Management**: ‚úÖ Complete  
- **Frame Templates**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Image Loading**: ‚úÖ Basic complete, manipulation pending
- **Text System**: ‚úÖ UI complete, rendering pending
- **Export Pipeline**: ‚è≥ Architecture ready, processing pending

The foundation is solid with excellent architecture and comprehensive UI. Ready for the advanced image processing and export functionality that will complete the migration from the Python version.
