# Analysis and Resolution of Electron Developer Tools Not Running
## Problem Symptoms
When running an Electron app, the main window or developer tools do not appear at all, and only the app icon briefly appears before disappearing or no response is observed.
## Cause Analysis
The root cause of this issue is that the settings within the `createMainWindow` function in the `src/main/index.ts` file are overly complex, and unexpected errors occur due to interactions between certain options.
1.  **Complex `BrowserWindow` settings:**
    *   The `show: false` option and the `ready-to-show` event were used together to display the window after it was ready. During this process, if problems such as the renderer process failing to load occur, the `ready-to-show` event will not be triggered, and the window will never be displayed.
    *   Numerous options such as window size, minimum/maximum size, and security-related `webPreferences` are set, and if any of these cause problems in a specific environment, window creation itself may fail.
2.  **Uncertain timing of `openDevTools()` call:**
*   The location where the `openDevTools()` function, which opens the developer tools, was called has been changed multiple times. If this function is called before the `webContents` object is fully prepared, the developer tools may not open.
3.  **Cascading errors:**
    *   The most critical mistake was accidentally deleting the `mainWindow.loadFile(...)` line. This code is a critical part of loading the UI in the renderer process, so without it, the app would display an empty window with no content. This resulted in the app not being visible, even if all other settings were correct.
## Solution
To resolve the issue, we used the **“simplify for stability”** strategy.
1.  **Simplify the `createMainWindow` function:**
*   We removed all complex options such as `show`, `ready-to-show`, and others.
    
*  Only the most basic `width`, `height`, and `webPreferences` settings were left to ensure that `BrowserWindow` is always created.
2.  **Restore and fix essential code:**
*  The accidentally deleted `mainWindow.loadFile(...)` line was restored to ensure that the renderer process is loaded.
3.  **Fixed the timing of the `openDevTools()` call:**
*   We called `openDevTools()` immediately after the window was created and `loadFile` was called, ensuring that the developer tools open regardless of other conditions.
### Final modified `createMainWindow` function (simplified version)
```typescript
private createMainWindow(): void {
  
this.mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 1200,
    height: 800,
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, ‘../preload/index.js’),
      contextIsolation: true,
      nodeIntegration: false,
    },
  });
  
// Load the renderer
  if (this.isDevelopment) {
    void this.mainWindow.loadFile(path.join(__dirname, ‘../renderer/index.html’));
  } else {
    void this.mainWindow.loadFile(path.join(__dirname, ‘../renderer/index.html’));
  
}
  this.mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
this.mainWindow.on(‘closed’, () => {
this.mainWindow = null;
});
}
```
## Conclusion
In the initialization process of an Electron app, it is more important to ensure that the most basic functions (window creation, content loading) work properly than to focus on complex settings. When issues arise, it is effective to remove settings one by one to reproduce the problem with the minimum amount of code, and then gradually add functionality back from there.
